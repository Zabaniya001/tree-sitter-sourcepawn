## Q&A 

**Q: What is the point of this project if [the other Sourcepawn Treesitter project](https://github.com/nilshelmig/tree-sitter-sourcepawn) already exists?**
A: None, really. This is just my take, my attempt, on making a parser. Creating one for Sourcepawn was just a good personal excuse to get into it.

**Q: Should I use this one or [the other one](https://github.com/nilshelmig/tree-sitter-sourcepawn)?**
A: The other one, without a doubt. As I've mentioned, this is just a personal project to get acquainted with parsers and Treesitter. This is not ready for use whatsoever, since there are still a ton of [unsupported things](#Roadmap) that the other one supports.
